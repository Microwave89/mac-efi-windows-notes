#The Very Minimum USB Installation HDD

NOTE: USB REMOVABLE MEDIA HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED.
FOR A QUICK INFORMATION WHAT THE USB KEY LOOKS LIKE PLEASE SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM!

Very core of windows10 efiboot flash installer
--> Note, the ESP preceding the flash installer partition is not required to contain a single file. You can easily unhide the partition and add an efi shell there named \efi\boot\bootx64.efi.

Realm of efi bootmgr (\efi\boot\bootx64.efi) startup:
!\efi\microsoft\boot\fonts\ && !\efi\microsoft\boot\bcd:
- Hang while further displaying mac boot selection
(!\efi\microsoft\boot\fonts\ || !\efi\microsoft\boot\resources\bootres.dll) && \efi\microsoft\boot\bcd:
- show and hang at blackscreen
\efi\microsoft\boot\fonts\ && \efi\microsoft\boot\resources\bootres.dll && !\efi\microsoft\boot\bcd:
- Show error 0xc000000f that specific file bcd not found
\efi\microsoft\boot\fonts\ && \efi\microsoft\boot\resources\bootres.dll && \efi\microsoft\boot\bcd
- Show error 0xc000000f that device does not exist or could not be accessed
==> at this point the bcd file could be interpreted and error display has been setup properly. The information in bcd file becomes relevant.

By viewing the bcd file with a hex editor one can see that there's referred to a boot.sdi as well as a boot.wim file.
Realm of the bcd information:
!\boot\boot.sdi && \sources\boot.wim
- Show error 0xc000000f that device does not exist or could not be accessed
&& \boot\boot.sdi && !\sources\boot.wim
- Show error 0xc000000f that device does not exist or could not be accessed
&& \boot\boot.sdi && \sources\boot.wim
- no error, windows install dialog should appear.
==> Now regedit wpeutil and many other commands work in RE shell, and windows is ready to install.

Upon installation in US English and location German (Switzerland) apparently some media driver is missing. Error is "A media driver your computer needs is missing"

In the following one can see the message is completely misleading:
\sources\setup.exe
- Error message correctly states that the install.wim file is missing.
\sources\install.wim
- All ok, activation dialog should pop up

Install.wim is now in charge of a successful continuation of the wizard. No problems including drive selection dialog.

Realm of install.wim:
- No errors. Installation just continues flawlessly.

After installation Windows needs to be launched via a
newly created EFI Boot entry.

Realm of Windows 10 on internal disk:
- No errors.

Windows will reboot a few times, so you are recommended to
have a keen eye on it in order to select EFI Boot each time.
After that you made it!

LAYOUT OF USB HARD DISK DRIVE FOR MAC EFI BASED WINDOWS 10 INSTALLATION:

/dev/disk1s1 aka /dev/sdb1 <== formatted as fat32
- /efi/boot/bootx64.efi <== bootx64.efi is efi shell v1
- /startup.nsh <== optional configuration of efi shell environment, behaves like autoexec.bat

/dev/disk1s2 aka /dev/sdb2 <== formatted as fat32
- /efi/boot/bootx64.efi <== efi kind bootmgr aka "bootmgfw.efi"
- /efi/microsoft/boot/bcd
- /efi/microsoft/boot/fonts/{some random fonts here...}
- /efi/microsoft/boot/resources/bootres.dll
- /boot/boot.sdi
- /sources/boot.wim
- /sources/setup.exe
- /sources/install.wim

Yep, I was quite puzzled what the entire Windows 10 x64 1607 Anniversary Build Installer essentially boiled down to...
